# hepa-fan
A 3D printable interface between HEPA filter and PC fan

This is a modified version of the original script posted by Big Clive here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vmh2Ip2Vxg

Now the script accepts additional parameters, namely:
- Fan size (I'm using 140mm)
- Spacing between mounting holes and fan edge (typically 7.5mm)

The script has 116mm filter hole by default (For Xiaomi air purifier filter).

Additionally, three sample stl outputs are provided:
- With 2mm walls
- With 2.8mm walls
- With 2.8mm walls and extra tall, to avoid 3D printing supports
